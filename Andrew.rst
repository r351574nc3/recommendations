Andrew is the most humble software engineer I have ever 
met. I have no doubt about that. This is exceptional
because Andrew is also one of the most stellar python
programmers I have ever met. The combination results
in the equivalent of cold fusion. An endless and ever-
replenishing supply of source code. Andrew continuously
astonishes with the amount of energy he has to produce
results, features, and support for products. In my
industry, Andrew is the rarest of unicorns.
