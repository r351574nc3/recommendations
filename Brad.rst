When I first met Brad, he already had a great deal of 
experience provisioning and managing Linux systems. Everyday
since then, he has amassed even more knowledge and
experience that today dwarfs a plethora. It has been my
pleasure to work with him. He is not just self-motivated, but
motivates others. Brad is one of the most humble developers I 
know to his advantage. If there is anything he does not know
or understand, he steps up and asks, learns, and grows. Brad
only ever looks up. Never down.
