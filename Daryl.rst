I joined Daryl's team alone as part of an acquisition from
another company. Daryl welcomed me openly and was vital
to my success within the team. His knowledge, encouragement,
and skills helped me to excel. Daryl was both humble and patient.
He helped me to not just build my own confidence, but to gain
the confidence of the rest of the team which was essential 
for my role. Daryl's initiative and empathy for others makes
him an ideal leader.
