David was the lead on the project I worked on. His
technical guidance and knowledge of the domain were 
instrumental to our project. He had a direct vision
and goals that he diligently sought. While unwaivering 
in his will to complete tasks and reach goals, David 
was also very open to new ideas and new approaches. 
Mentally, he could adjust goals, design, or process
instantaneously. David was also very proficient at
articulating direction and guidance to those within
and without the team. I would work with David again
without a second thought.
