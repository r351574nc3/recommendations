Mahesh worked on the same project I was working on. Time over time, Mahesh would go beyond what was required and provided valuable input on process, quality improvement, automation, development strategy, and best practices. Mahesh made every effort available to him to improve the quality of our software and the efficiency of our work output. Mahesh is also friendly and open minded. He makes an effort to work closely with team members in order to properly determine what requirements are. Mahesh also regularly seeks to advance his knowledge and experience. He eagerly seeks out improved solutions and even volunteers for opportunities to innovate.
